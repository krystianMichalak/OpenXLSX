# This repository is based on OpenXLSX library 
which can be found here:
https://github.com/troldal/OpenXLSX.git

It is "reduced" and restructured version of OpenXLSX library. With this changes it is a lot easier to create and use conan package manager.
Maybe in near future this repo will get converted to a standard fork of base repository and will get restructured with Cmake files only.

To create conan package:
- Download file: \conan\conanfile.py
- Run command: conan create . demo/testing from directory containing this file
